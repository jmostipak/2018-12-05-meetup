# DecembeR Holiday Party & Collaborative Planning  
  
Materials from our [December 2018 Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-chicago/events/256428023/).  
  
For our collaborative coding activity, we have the following datasets:  
  
  
| Filename      | Description |
| :---        | :---        |
| **signin.csv**      | Data from the Meetup sign-in form (the google form you fill out when you come to a meetup).      |
| **meetup.csv**   | Event information from our [Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-chicago), pulled from Meetup via the `meetupr` package.        |
| **rladies_twitter.csv**    | Tweets from the #RLadies Hashtag, pulled from Twitter via the `rtweet` package. These tweets were compiled last summer for an [NLP Study Group](https://github.com/rladies-nlp) activity and an updated set of tweets was added to this data set on 12/4/2018 (`rtweet` only pulls tweets from the last 6-9 days so this data is not continuous).    |  
  
  
We also have responses from our [End-of-Year Survey](https://tinyurl.com/rladies-survey). This dataset will be added during the Meetup.
